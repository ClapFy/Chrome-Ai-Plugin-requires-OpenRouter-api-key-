## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Uses the latest Chrome extension manifest version
- **Service Worker**: Background script handles screen capture and API calls
- **Content Script**: Runs on web pages to gather additional context
- **Popup Interface**: User-friendly interface with dual-mode support
- **Dual API Integration**: Handles both image-based and text-only AI requests
- **Native Screen Capture**: Uses Chrome's desktopCapture API for reliable screen capture
- **Configuration System**: Centralized settings in `config.js`

### Permissions

- `activeTab`: Access to the currently active tab
- `desktopCapture`: Permission to capture screen content using Chrome's native APIs
- `storage`: Store API keys and token usage data securely
- `scripting`: Execute scripts in tabs when needed
- `tabs`: Query and interact with browser tabs for screen capture

### API Integration

The extension integrates with OpenRouter API using:
- **Model**: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` (supports both text and image analysis)
- **Endpoint**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
- **Authentication**: User-provided API keys for personalized access
- **Dual Mode Support**: 
  - Screen mode: Sends image + text to AI
  - General mode: Sends text-only to AI
- **Token Tracking**: Estimates and tracks token usage per user

### Screen Capture Implementation

The extension uses Chrome's native `desktopCapture` API for reliable screen capture:
1. **Permission Request**: User selects which screen/window to capture
2. **Stream Processing**: Captures video stream and converts to image
3. **Local Processing**: Screenshot is processed locally before sending to AI
4. **Privacy First**: Only the captured image is sent, no other data

### Token Management System

- **Automatic Tracking**: Estimates token usage based on question and response length
- **Persistent Storage**: Token usage is saved across browser sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bar shows usage with color-coded warnings
- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset their token usage if needed
- **Limit Enforcement**: Prevents usage when token limit is reached

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No screenshot available"**
   - Make sure you're in Screen Questions mode
   - Capture the screen first before asking questions
   - Check that screen capture permissions are granted

2. **"Failed to capture screen"**
   - Ensure you've granted screen capture permissions
   - Try refreshing the extension
   - Make sure you're on a supported page (not chrome:// URLs)
   - Check that Chrome's desktop capture is working properly

3. **"Please enter your OpenRouter API key first"**
   - Enter your API key in the designated field
   - Make sure the key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check that you have credits in your OpenRouter account

4. **"API Error"**
   - Verify your OpenRouter API key is correct
   - Check that you have credits in your OpenRouter account
   - Ensure you're not hitting rate limits

5. **"Token limit reached"**
   - You've used your 100,000 token allocation
   - Click "Reset Usage" button to clear your count
   - Contact support if you need more tokens

6. **Extension not loading**
   - Verify all files are present in the extension directory
   - Check Chrome's developer console for errors
   - Try reloading the extension

7. **General AI questions not working**
   - Make sure you're in General AI mode
   - Verify your API key is entered correctly
   - Check that you have credits in your OpenRouter account

8. **Screen capture permissions denied**
   - Go to Chrome Settings > Privacy and security > Site Settings
   - Check Screen Capture permissions
   - Ensure the extension has permission to capture screen

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages from "AI Screen Assistant"

## Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Screenshots are processed locally before sending to AI
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and token usage are stored in Chrome's secure storage
- **No Data Collection**: The extension doesn't collect or store user data
- **API Security**: Only necessary data is sent to OpenRouter API
- **Mode-Specific Data**: Screen mode sends images, general mode sends only text
- **Native APIs**: Uses Chrome's built-in screen capture for security and reliability
- **Token Isolation**: Each user's token usage is tracked separately
- **Personal API Keys**: Users control their own API access and costs
